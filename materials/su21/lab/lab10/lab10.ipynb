    "Medical testing is very important, especially for cancer. A basic cancer screening involves looking for cancer before a person has any symptoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cancer screening is not 100% reliable, and it can have risks. There are cases in which someone without cancer or with a benign tumor sees a positive test result. There are also cases where someone with cancer can receive a negative result. (“Positive” implies an indication of cancer in this context.) The first case, called a false positive, could cause anxiety for a patient and lead to further testing that may be risky and involve unnecessary radiation. In the second case, called a false negative, a person would not receive the necessary information and possible treatment for their condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability can provide insight into the accuracy of initial cancer tests. For example, you can compute the chance that a person has cancer given the results of a diagnostic test by combining information from different probability distributions. You’ll see that the chance Person X does have cancer even if they receive a positive result is not necessarily 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that conditional probabilities offer just one line of insight to understanding a test result and that this statistical approach does not take into account important factors like heredity or environment that come to affect a person’s health and diagnoses. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/prevention/screening.htm) (CDC) recommends getting preventative cancer screenings, and one should always consult a doctor if they are concerned about their health.

    "# 4. Tree diagrams\n",
    "A tree diagram is another useful visualization that helps us calculate conditional probabilities.  It is easiest to draw a tree diagram when the probabilities are presented in a slightly different way - specifically, we first look at the probabilities of cancer in the entire population, and then examine the rates of positive test results within the cancer and no cancer groups.  For example, people often summarize the information in your `cancer` table using 3 numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The overall probability of having cancer is **`p_cancer`**.  (This is called the *base rate* or *marginal probability* of the disease.)\n",
    "2. Given that Person X has cancer, the probability of a positive test result is **`p_pos_given_cancer`**.  (This is called the *sensitivity* of the test.  Higher values of `p_pos_given_cancer` mean the test is more useful.)\n",
    "3. Given that Person X doesn't have cancer, the probability of a positive test result is **`p_pos_given_nocancer`**.  (This is called the *false positive rate* of the test.  Higher values of `p_pos_given_nocancer` mean the test is less useful.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You already saw that the base rate of cancer was .01 in the previous section.  `p_pos_given_cancer` and `p_pos_given_nocancer` can be computed using the same method you used to compute the conditional probability of cancer given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The information we have on cancer can be represented in this tree diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "                      /    \\\n",
