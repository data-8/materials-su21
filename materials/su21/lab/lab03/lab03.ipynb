    "Welcome to Lab 3!\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've used Python to manipulate numbers and work with tables. But we need to discuss data types to deepen our understanding of how to work with data in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll first see how to represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text.  A piece of text is called a *string* in Python. You'll also see how to work with *arrays* of data, such as all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. Lastly, you'll create tables and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lab Queue**: You can find the Lab Queue at [lab.data8.org](https://lab.data8.org/). Whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification, add yourself to the queue to get help from a GSI or academic intern! Please list your name, breakout room number, and purpose on your ticket!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: If you are not attending lab, you have to complete this lab and submit by Wednesday, 2/3 before 8:59 A.M. PST in order to receive lab credit. Otherwise, please attend the lab you are enrolled in, get checked off with your GSI or academic intern **AND** submit this assignment by the end of the lab section (with whatever progress you've made) to receive lab credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submission**: Once you're finished, select \"Save and Checkpoint\" in the File menu and then execute the submit cell below (or at the end). The result will contain a link that you can use to check that your assignment has been submitted successfully."
