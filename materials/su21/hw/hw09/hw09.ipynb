    "Oftentimes, when conducting statistical inference, you'll want your estimate of a population parameter to have a certain accuracy. It is common to measure the accuracy of an estimate using the SD of the estimate--as the SD goes down, your estimate becomes less variable. As a result, the width of the confidence interval for your estimate decreases (think about why this is true). We know from the Central Limit Theorem that when we estimate a sample mean, the SD of the sample mean decreases as the sample size increases (again, think about why this is true).   \n",
